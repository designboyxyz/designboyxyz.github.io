      When we observe a language, we associate some language ideology to it—in other words, we associate different language forms to social, economic, and cultural systems. 
      <br/><br/>

The language of market logic, toxic productivity, western ideals, consumerist materialism, etc. have a quality to them that we must learn to intuit. Messages, performances, and presences that seem harmless on the surface, can be formed through pernicious ideology, and thus reinforce its corresponding architecture. 
<br/><br/>
The language of hegemony ‘loops', stagnates, and nostalgically references itself, because it’s progression implies its termination. The loop follows a rigid structure that pragmalinguistically represents the commodification, privatization, and rationalization of language—it is fixed in central universals, polarity, and a subjective-objective split. it is ‘owned’, but its usage does not imply ownership.
<br/><br/>
The loop is inauthentic, performative, gimmicky, and regurgitative. it seeks to drone on until its architecture finally pollutes every inch of space. We say no to the loop—and we embody and encode the break point through our presence. We catch the loop by identifying the conditionals—and break out of it, interrupt it, and progress out of its clutch on spacetime. 
<br/><br/>
We are also tasked with writing aesthetically appealing code, and a part of that involves removing redundancies and loops from our own scripts. As emily drabinski noted, “at the moment identity is fixed, it constitutes an unnamed excess, the ‘stuff’ of other ways of being that are not represented by the [representation].”
<br/><br/>
In the privatized spacetime of social media—a spacetime informed by invisible laws that enforce singular identity, force competition over contested space (timeline), and run along a value-function that encourages, rewards, and gives visibility to embodiments of the loop—becoming the breakpoint for language to progress is a revolutionary act. In doing so, we take the power of scripting away from the programmers of the hegemony, and we inject our poetic—we hack the platform and glitch consensus out. 
<br/><br/>
We fuck up the timeline, interrupt the loop at its site of operation—just as graffiti confronts and slows down pedestrians. To those whose wetware is still fully integrated to the architecture of the loop, our code cannot be decrypted—but to those who have begun to feel its dystopian creepiness, they gradually enter utopia by progressing along the rabbit hole of hyperlinked material  we archive as we, ourselves, progress even deeper into hyperspace...
